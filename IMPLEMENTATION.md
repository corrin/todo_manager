## Needs Testing

### Task System
- ⏳ Todoist provider implementation
  - API integration using Todoist Python SDK
  - Project mapping and task synchronization
  - Instruction task handling
  - Authentication through API key
  - Error handling for API failures
  
- ⏳ SQLite provider implementation
  - Local database setup and initialization
  - Task CRUD operations
  - JSON serialization for task data
  - File-based authentication verification

### Data Persistence
- ⏳ Task synchronization with database storage
- ⏳ Error handling for database operations
- ⏳ Transaction management and rollback

### User Experience
- ⏳ Form submission and validation
- ⏳ Error messaging and feedback
- ⏳ Navigation flow and redirects

## Incomplete Components

### Task System
- 🔲 Outlook Tasks provider (required but lower priority)
  - Framework defined but minimal implementation
  - Leverages existing O365 authentication
  
- 🔲 Google Tasks provider (required but lower priority)
  - Framework defined but minimal implementation
  - Leverages existing Google authentication

### AI System
- 🔲 Grok provider (placeholder only)
  - Basic structure without API integration
  - Needs implementation or removal

### Database API
- 🔲 Complete CRUD operations in database routes
- 🔲 Robust API endpoints for database access
- 🔲 Input validation and error handling

### Authentication System
- 🔲 Consolidation of user management approaches
  - Currently has competing file-based and database-based systems
  - Need to standardize on database approach

### UI Components
- 🔲 Task management interface
- 🔲 Instruction editor
- 🔲 Provider status indicators
- 🔲 Scheduling view
- 🔲 Enhanced settings page

## Known Issues

### Authentication System
- ⚠️ Dual user management systems causing potential confusion
- ⚠️ GoogleAuth implementation contains commented code needing cleanup

### Calendar Integration
- ⚠️ Time zone handling issues for calendar events
- ⚠️ Token refresh occasionally requires manual intervention
- ⚠️ OAuth error handling could be improved

### Task System
- ⚠️ Instruction task creation may be unreliable in Todoist
- ⚠️ Credential management split between file system and database
- ⚠️ Error handling needs improvement for failed API calls

## Development Priorities

1. **Consolidate User Management**
   - Migrate to database-only approach
   - Remove file-based user management
   - Ensure consistent user handling across the application

2. **Test Task Providers**
   - Validate Todoist integration with live account
   - Test SQLite provider with significant data
   - Fix any issues discovered during testing

3. **Expand Database API**
   - Implement complete CRUD operations
   - Add robust API endpoints
   - Ensure consistent error handling

4. **Address Calendar Integration Issues**
   - Improve time zone handling
   - Enhance token refresh reliability
   - Improve OAuth error feedback

5. **Implement UI Components**
   - Build task management interface
   - Create instruction editor
   - Add provider status indicators
   - Implement scheduling view

6. **Future Enhancements**
   - Complete Outlook and Google Tasks providers
   - Implement or remove Grok provider
   - Add comprehensive testing suite
   - Enhance documentation
