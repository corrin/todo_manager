  - ✅ Event CRUD operations
  - ✅ Calendar synchronization
  - ✅ Error handling and token refresh
- ✅ Office 365 integration with Microsoft Graph API
  - ✅ MSAL-based authentication
  - ✅ Asynchronous API operations
  - ✅ Token refresh with error handling
  - ✅ Proper permission scopes
- ✅ Calendar account management UI
- ✅ Synchronization endpoints and status reporting
- ✅ Token refresh scheduler in background thread

### AI System
- ✅ AI provider interface and manager pattern
- ✅ OpenAI provider with API key management
- ✅ Text generation and completion methods
- ✅ Authentication and credential storage

### Flask Application
- ✅ Main application structure and factory function
- ✅ Route handling for core functionality
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Template structure and static file serving
- ✅ Configuration management with environment variables

## Needs Testing

### Task System
- ⏳ Todoist provider implementation
  - API integration using Todoist Python SDK
  - Project mapping and task synchronization
  - Instruction task handling
  - Authentication through API key
  - Error handling for API failures

### Data Persistence
- ⏳ Task synchronization with database storage
- ⏳ Error handling for database operations
- ⏳ Transaction management and rollback

### User Experience
- ⏳ Form submission and validation
- ⏳ Error messaging and feedback
- ⏳ Navigation flow and redirects

## Incomplete Components

### Task System
- 🔲 Outlook Tasks provider: Partially Implemented: Core authentication and task fetching are developed. Task creation, update, and AI instruction functionalities are largely stubs and require completion.
  
- 🔲 Google Tasks provider: Partially Implemented: Core authentication and task fetching are developed. Task creation, update, and AI instruction functionalities are largely stubs and require completion.

### AI System
- 🔲 Grok provider (placeholder only)
  - Basic structure without API integration
  - Needs implementation or removal

### Database API
- 🔲 Complete CRUD operations in database routes
- 🔲 Robust API endpoints for database access
- 🔲 Input validation and error handling

### Authentication System
- 🔲 Refine user management: Further clarify the role of `database.UserDataManager` in relation to Flask-Login and the `User` model, and streamline its responsibilities.

### UI Components
- 🔲 Task management interface
- 🔲 Instruction editor
- 🔲 Provider status indicators
- 🔲 Scheduling view
- 🔲 Enhanced settings page

## Known Issues

### Authentication System

### Calendar Integration
- ⚠️ Time zone handling issues for calendar events
- ⚠️ Token refresh occasionally requires manual intervention
- ⚠️ OAuth error handling could be improved

### Task System
- ⚠️ Instruction task creation may be unreliable in Todoist
- ⚠️ Error handling needs improvement for failed API calls

## Development Priorities

1. **Refine User Management Roles**
   - Further clarify the role of `database.UserDataManager` in relation to Flask-Login and the `User` model.
   - Streamline `UserDataManager` responsibilities, focusing on managing user-associated data and credentials.

2. **Test Todoist Task Provider**
   - Validate Todoist integration with live account.
   - Fix any issues discovered during testing.

3. **Expand Database API**
   - Implement complete CRUD operations
   - Add robust API endpoints
   - Ensure consistent error handling

4. **Address Calendar Integration Issues**
   - Improve time zone handling
   - Enhance token refresh reliability
   - Improve OAuth error feedback

5. **Implement UI Components**
   - Build task management interface
   - Create instruction editor
   - Add provider status indicators
   - Implement scheduling view

6. **Future Enhancements**
   - Complete Core Features for Outlook and Google Tasks Providers (task modification, AI instructions).
   - Implement or remove Grok provider.
   - Add comprehensive testing suite.
   - Enhance documentation.
