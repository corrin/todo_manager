# Project Progress

## Completed Components

- Core application structure
- Authentication flow (Google Identity Services)
- Database models and ORM integration
- OpenAI provider and API integration
- Calendar providers (Google Calendar and Office 365)
- Meeting/calendar synchronization
- Provider pattern implementation
- Calendar account management
- Task provider interface and manager

## Incomplete/Placeholder Items

### AI System
- Grok provider (placeholder only)

### Database System
- Only basic test routes implemented for database access
- Most CRUD operations exist as commented placeholders
- Need to implement database API endpoints

### Task System
- **Todoist Provider**:
  - Implementation complete but needs testing with live account
  - API integration using official Todoist Python SDK
  - May have reliability issues with instruction task creation
  
- **SQLite Provider**:
  - Implementation complete but needs validation
  - Local database implementation for task storage
  - CRUD operations implemented but not thoroughly tested
  
- **Outlook Tasks Provider**:
  - Required but lower priority (can be addressed later)
  - Placeholder implementation with minimal functionality
  - Reuses O365 authentication from calendar integration
  - Framework defined but most API operations stubbed out
  
- **Google Tasks Provider**:
  - Required but lower priority (can be addressed later)
  - Placeholder implementation with minimal functionality
  - Reuses Google authentication from calendar integration
  - Framework defined but most API operations stubbed out
  
- **Task UI**:
  - Missing task management interface
  - Missing instruction editor
  - Missing provider status indicators

### Authentication System
- Two competing user management systems:
  - File-based approach (`auth/user_manager.py`)
  - Database approach (`database/user_manager.py`)
- Need to consolidate into a single approach (database preferred)

## Known Issues

### AI System
- Grok provider is non-functional
- GPT model configuration may need tuning

### Task System
- Task providers not fully tested with live accounts
- Instruction task creation may be unreliable in Todoist
- Authentication logic uses file-based credential storage (inconsistent with DB approach)
- Outlook and Google Tasks providers are placeholders but required eventually
- Credential management split between file system and database
- Error handling needs improvement for failed API calls

### Database System
- Minimal route implementation
- Missing proper API endpoints
- Existing migrations but no automated testing

### Calendar/Meeting System
- Time zone handling issues for calendar events
- Token refresh occasionally requires manual intervention
- OAuth error handling could be improved with better user feedback
- Reauthorization flow works but user experience could be enhanced

## Next Development Focus

1. Consolidate user management systems
2. Expand database API routes
3. Address calendar integration issues
4. Test and fix Todoist and SQLite providers
5. Leave placeholder providers (Outlook Tasks, Google Tasks) for future development
6. Implement UI components
7. Comprehensive testing of all implemented providers
