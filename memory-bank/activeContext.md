- ‚úÖ Authentication flows 
- ‚úÖ OpenAI provider
- ‚úÖ Calendar providers (Google, O365)
- ‚úÖ User authentication
- ‚úÖ Flask application structure

## Incomplete Components

### AI System
- **OpenAI Provider**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented
  
- **Grok Provider**: üî≤ PLACEHOLDER ONLY
  - Only skeleton structure exists
  - No actual API integration
  - Authentication UI routes defined but non-functional
  - Commented out in AIManager initialization
  - MUST be implemented or removed

### Auth System
- **GoogleAuth**: ‚úÖ Mostly implemented
  - Google Identity Services integration
  - JWT token verification

  - Async support for API operations
  
- **Office 365 Provider**: ‚úÖ Robust implementation
  - Microsoft Graph API integration
  - MSAL-based authentication
  - Token refresh with error handling
  - Proper permission scopes
  - Async implementation
  
- **Meeting Routes**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive
  - Calendar account management
  - OAuth callbacks and processing
  - Calendar synchronization
  - Token refresh handling
  - Error management with reauthorization flows
  
- **Known Issues**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Some challenges
  - Time zone handling for calendar events
  - Token refresh occasionally requires manual intervention
  - OAuth error handling could be improved

### Task System
- **Core Architecture**: ‚úÖ Well-designed
  - Abstract TaskProvider interface with clear contracts
  - Task dataclass for cross-provider compatibility
  - TaskManager for provider coordination
  - Task hierarchy and ordering functionality
  - Follows consistent provider pattern

- **Todoist Provider**: ‚è≥ NEEDS TESTING
  - API integration with Todoist Python SDK
  - Project mapping and task synchronization
  - Instruction task handling
  - Authentication through API key
  - Needs validation with live account
  
- **SQLite Provider**: ‚è≥ NEEDS TESTING
  - Local database implementation
  - Basic CRUD operations
  - File-based storage in user directory
  - Simple authentication verification
  - Needs validation with real usage
  
- **Outlook Tasks Provider**: üî≤ REQUIRED BUT LOWER PRIORITY
  - Leverages existing O365 authentication
  - Microsoft Graph API integration framework
  - Authentication flow defined
  - Most functionality stubbed out
  - Required eventually but not urgent
  
- **Google Tasks Provider**: üî≤ REQUIRED BUT LOWER PRIORITY
  - Leverages existing Google authentication
  - Authentication flow defined
  - Credential reuse from calendar integration
  - Most API operations stubbed out
  - Required eventually but not urgent

- **Task Routes**: ‚è≥ PARTIAL
  - Task synchronization endpoints
  - Account management
  - Provider coordination
  - Missing UI components

- **Integration Points**: ‚è≥ PARTIAL
  - Smart reuse of calendar credentials
  - Mapping between calendar and task providers
  - Database model relationships
  - File-based credential storage (inconsistent with DB approach)

### Flask Application Structure
- **Application Factory**: ‚úÖ Well-implemented
  - Clean `create_app()` function for Flask initialization
  - Proper blueprint registration
  - Dependency injection through factory functions
  - Environment variable configuration
  - Error handling setup

- **Blueprints**: ‚úÖ Well-organized
  - Modular route organization by feature area
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - Consistent URL prefixing
  - Blueprint initialization pattern

- **Core Routes**: ‚úÖ Complete
  - Login/logout handling
  - Settings management
  - Basic task display
  - Error handling
  - User session management

- **Background Processing**: ‚úÖ Implemented
  - Token refresh scheduler in background thread
  - Proper thread management
  - Async support for background operations

- **Configuration**: ‚úÖ Complete
  - Settings from environment variables
  - Proper secret management
  - Development/production configuration
  - Static file and template configuration

- **UI Integration**: ‚è≥ PARTIAL
  - Basic templates in place
  - Flash messaging for user feedback
  - Missing more comprehensive UI components
  - CSS/JS integration needs assessment

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix Placeholders**
   - Complete or remove Grok provider
   - Test and fix Todoist/SQLite providers
   - Leave Outlook/Google Task providers as placeholders for now

2. **Consolidate Auth System**
   - Resolve conflict between file-based and database user management
   - Clean up GoogleAuth implementation (remove commented code)
   - Ensure consistent user management across the application
   - **PRIORITY**: Migrate to database-only user management, removing file-based approach

3. **Expand Database Routes**
   - Implement the commented CRUD operations
   - Add proper API endpoints for database access
   - Ensure consistent error handling

4. **Address Calendar Integration Issues**
   - Improve time zone handling for calendar events
   - Enhance token refresh mechanisms for better reliability
   - Improve OAuth error handling and user feedback

5. **UI Implementation**
   - Build task management interface
   - Create instruction editor
   - Add provider status indicators
   - Implement scheduling view

6. **Testing Priority**
   - Test all task providers with live accounts
   - Verify authentication flows
   - Validate error handling

## Active Decisions
- Deciding whether to complete or remove Grok provider
- Outlook and Google Tasks providers are needed but are lower priority and will be addressed later
- Considering UI implementation priority
- Evaluating additional service integrations
- Need to decide on file-based vs database-based user management 
  - Preferred solution: Use database-based approach only
