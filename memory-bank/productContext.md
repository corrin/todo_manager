# Product Context

## Why Task Master Exists
Task Master addresses the common problem of translating a growing todo list into actionable time blocks on a calendar. It bridges the gap between task management and time management, helping users allocate appropriate time for their work.

## Problems Task Master Solves

### 1. Task-to-Time Conversion Challenge
Many people maintain task lists but struggle to convert them into actual time blocks on their calendars. Task Master automates this process, ensuring tasks get the dedicated time they need for completion.

### 2. Scheduling Complexity
Manually scheduling tasks around existing appointments is time-consuming and error-prone. Task Master intelligently fits tasks into available time slots while respecting fixed appointments.

### 3. Time Allocation Consistency
Users often have recurring areas of focus that need regular attention. Task Master supports natural language rules (e.g., "work on my hobby project twice a week") to maintain consistent time allocation across important life areas.

### 4. Multiple System Management
Managing separate task and calendar systems creates friction. Task Master integrates with popular tools (Todoist, Google Calendar, Office 365) to create a seamless workflow between these systems.

## How Task Master Works

1. **Task Collection**: The system connects to task providers to collect user tasks
2. **Rule Processing**: AI interprets natural language scheduling rules
3. **Calendar Integration**: Available time slots are identified on user calendars
4. **Intelligent Scheduling**: Tasks are assigned to time blocks based on priority, rules, and available time
5. **Calendar Creation**: Appointments are created on the user's calendar
