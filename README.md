# todo_manager

This app is a virtual assistant.  It takes your todo list and converts it into calendar appointments focused on tasks.
It supports rules, e.g. "I want to work on maintaining my friendships every week, and my hobby project at least twice a week, and my job every day"
and it will schedule tasks to align with those rules.
