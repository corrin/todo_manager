Considering your future plans to potentially integrate other AI services like Gemini or Claude, as well as support multiple calendar providers like Office 365, it's a good idea to design your architecture in a modular and extensible way.

Given the abstract layers you mentioned - database layer (Todoist), "smarts" layer (ChatGPT), and calendar layer (Google) - here's a suggested approach:

Create separate modules for each layer:
database_module: This module will handle interactions with the database layer, currently planned to be Todoist. You can define an abstract base class or interface that outlines the common methods for interacting with the database, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
ai_module: This module will handle the integration with the AI service layer, currently planned to be ChatGPT using OpenAI. You can define an abstract base class or interface that outlines the common methods for interacting with the AI service, such as generating text, answering questions, or providing suggestions.
calendar_module: This module will handle the integration with the calendar layer, currently planned to be Google Calendar. You can define an abstract base class or interface that outlines the common methods for interacting with the calendar, such as retrieving events, creating events, updating events, and deleting events.
Implement concrete classes for each specific service:
For the database layer, you can create a concrete implementation called todoist_module that inherits from the abstract base class in database_module and implements the specific logic for interacting with Todoist.
For the AI service layer, you can create concrete implementations like openai_module, gemini_module, or claude_module that inherit from the abstract base class in ai_module and implement the specific logic for interacting with each AI service.
For the calendar layer, you can create concrete implementations like google_calendar_module and o365_calendar_module that inherit from the abstract base class in calendar_module and implement the specific logic for interacting with Google Calendar and Office 365 Calendar, respectively.
Use dependency injection or a factory pattern to instantiate the appropriate implementations based on configuration or user preferences:
In your main flask_app.py, you can define a configuration or settings module that specifies which specific implementations to use for each layer.
Use dependency injection or a factory function to create instances of the appropriate modules based on the configuration.
This allows you to easily switch between different implementations (e.g., using Gemini instead of OpenAI, or Office 365 Calendar instead of Google Calendar) without modifying the core logic of your application.
Here's a high-level example of how you can structure your modules:

python


Copy code
# database_module.py
class DatabaseInterface:
    def create_task(self, task_data):
        pass

    def get_tasks(self):
        pass

    # Other common methods for interacting with the database

# todoist_module.py
from database_module import DatabaseInterface

class TodoistModule(DatabaseInterface):
    def create_task(self, task_data):
        # Todoist-specific implementation for creating a task
        pass

    def get_tasks(self):
        # Todoist-specific implementation for retrieving tasks
        pass

    # Other Todoist-specific methods

# ai_module.py
class AIInterface:
    def generate_text(self, prompt):
        pass

    # Other common methods for interacting with the AI service

# openai_module.py
from ai_module import AIInterface

class OpenAIModule(AIInterface):
    def generate_text(self, prompt):
        # OpenAI-specific implementation for generating text
        pass

    # Other OpenAI-specific methods

# calendar_module.py
class CalendarInterface:
    def get_events(self):
        pass

    def create_event(self, event_data):
        pass

    # Other common methods for interacting with the calendar

# google_calendar_module.py
from calendar_module import CalendarInterface

class GoogleCalendarModule(CalendarInterface):
    def get_events(self):
        # Google Calendar-specific implementation for retrieving events
        pass

    def create_event(self, event_data):
        # Google Calendar-specific implementation for creating an event
        pass

    # Other Google Calendar-specific methods

# flask_app.py
from todoist_module import TodoistModule
from openai_module import OpenAIModule
from google_calendar_module import GoogleCalendarModule

def create_database_module():
    # Factory function to create the appropriate database module based on configuration
    return TodoistModule()

def create_ai_module():
    # Factory function to create the appropriate AI module based on configuration
    return OpenAIModule()

def create_calendar_module():
    # Factory function to create the appropriate calendar module based on configuration
    return GoogleCalendarModule()

# Rest of your Flask app code
By structuring your code in this modular and extensible way, you can easily accommodate future changes and integrate new services without significantly modifying the core logic of your application. It also promotes code reusability and maintainability.

Remember to adapt the module names, class names, and method signatures to fit your specific requirements and naming conventions.
